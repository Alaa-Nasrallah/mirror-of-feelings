    <h1>The Mirror of Feelings</h1>
    <h2>An Interactive Emotional Intelligence Play for Elementary Students</h2>

  <!-- About the Play -->
  <section id="about">
  <h2>About the Play</h2>
  <p>The Mirror of Feelings is a live, interactive theatrical experience designed to help elementary school students recognize, understand, and manage their emotions in healthy and age-appropriate ways.</p>
  <p>Through storytelling, music, movement, and direct audience participation, children learn that all emotions are valid, and that they always have a choice in how they respond to what they feel.</p>
  <p>The play follows two friends, Danny and Sam, as they prepare a birthday surprise that doesn't go exactly as planned. What starts as excitement slowly turns into moments of anxiety, anger, sadness, and eventually joy.</p>
  <p>As emotions become bigger and harder to manage, a magical character – The Mirror of Feelings – comes to life and helps the characters pause and reflect on what they are feeling.</p>

  <!-- What Is a Feeling -->
  <section id="feelings">
    <h2>What Is a Feeling?</h2>
    <p>Everyone has feelings. Feelings are signals from inside us, from our body, heart, and mind.</p>
<p>Some feelings feel light and comfortable. Others feel heavy, tight, or confusing.</p>
<p>All feelings are normal. They are not good or bad – they are messages from inside!</p>
<p>Feelings help us understand what we need, what matters to us, and how to take care of ourselves and others.</p>
<p>When we learn how to notice and understand our feelings, we gain a powerful skill for life.</p>

  <!-- Take-Home Booklet -->
  <section id="booklet">
  <h2>Take‑Home Booklet</h2>
  <p>The learning experience continues after the performance. Each student receives an interactive take‑home booklet designed to reinforce the lessons introduced during the play.</p>
  <p>The booklets help children:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice the COLOR Method through guided activities</li>
    <li>Reflect on emotions they experience in daily life</li>
    <li>Express feelings through drawing and simple writing</li>
    <li>Identify trusted adults they can turn to</li>
    <li>Apply emotional skills both at school and at home</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ensures the play is not a one‑time event, but a long‑lasting emotional learning experience.</p>
