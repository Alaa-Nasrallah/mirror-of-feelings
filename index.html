    <h2>An Interactive Emotional Intelligence Play for Elementary Students</h2>

  <!-- About the Play -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Play</h2>
    <p>The Mirror of Feelings is a live, interactive theatrical experience designed to help elementary school students recognize, understand, and manage their emotions in healthy and age‑appropriate ways.</p>
    <p>Through storytelling, music, movement, and direct audience participation, children learn that all emotions are valid, and that they always have a choice in how they respond to what they feel.</p>
    <p>The play follows two friends, Danny and Sam, as they prepare a birthday surprise that doesn’t go exactly as planned. What starts as excitement slowly turns into moments of anxiety, anger, sadness, and eventually joy.</p>
    <p>As emotions become bigger and harder to manage, a magical character – The Mirror of Feelings – comes to life and helps the characters pause and reflect on what they are feeling.</p>

  <section id="characters">
    <h2>Meet the Characters</h2>
    <div class="character-cards">
      <div class="card"><h3>Danny</h3><p>Energetic, cheerful, and deeply caring. He wants everything to be perfect and feels pressure when things might go wrong. Through Danny, children learn how anxiety feels in the body and how calming strategies like breathing can help.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><h3>Sam</h3><p>Curious, expressive, and sometimes impulsive. He experiences anger, sadness, and joy, learning that even heavy emotions can be released in healthy ways such as movement, hugging, or sharing with trusted adults.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><h3>The Mirror of Feelings</h3><p>A magical, friendly guide who senses emotions and helps children understand them. Rather than naming feelings for the characters, the Mirror encourages self‑discovery, reinforcing the idea that everyone is responsible for identifying and expressing their own emotions.</p></div>

  <!-- What Is a Feeling -->
  <section id="feelings">
    <h2>What Is a Feeling?</h2>
    <p>Everyone has feelings. Feelings are signals from inside us, from our body, heart, and mind.</p>
    <p>Some feelings feel light and comfortable. Others feel heavy, tight, or confusing.</p>
    <p>All feelings are normal. They are not good or bad – they are messages from inside!</p>
    <p>Feelings help us understand what we need, what matters to us, and how to take care of ourselves and others.</p>
    <p>When we learn how to notice and understand our feelings, we gain a powerful skill for life.</p>
